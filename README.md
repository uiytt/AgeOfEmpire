 **Minecraft version(s)** | :video_game: **1.17.1**

*Download :* SOON

AgeOfEmpire is a recreation of the **Minecraft** minigame from the french server **Epicube** (rest in peace, you were the best). It's a game that last about 1 hour and 30 minutes and involve either 2 or 4 teams (3-8 players each, but I recommend 6). Each team must gather resources in a custom map and use them to build buildings. Each building allow players to buy different items and each building can be destroyed by the other team once 45 minutes have passed. Additionally, at 20 minutes, all teams can now mine better resources at the middle of the map but be aware, the pvp is activated.

*Note that me and the builders are working with a content creator, which means there will be a short period where the plugin is only available to the creator before it becomes available to everyone.*
